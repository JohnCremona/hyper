Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 6
Input depth of recursion: Use old (0) or new scaled (1) version? 
Scaled version, depth = 35
Total before scaling: neg def = 15.1327, non = 142.587, unknown = 2.27987
(sum = 160)
Total after scaling: neg def = 0.0945797, non = 0.891171, unknown = 0.0142492
(sum = 1)
0.0945797 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.108829
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.891171
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.90542
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.898296
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0071246
