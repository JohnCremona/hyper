Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 6
Use full (0) or simplified (1) criterion? Input depth of recursion: 
After recursion in the quarter box, non = 0.461742, neg = 0.456543
0.114136 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.134564
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.865436
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.885864
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.87565
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0102143
