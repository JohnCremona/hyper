Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 8
Use full (0) or simplified (1) criterion? Input depth of recursion: 
After recursion in the quarter box, non = 0.450094, neg = 0.314863
0.0787157 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.137476
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.862524
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.921284
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.891904
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0293804
