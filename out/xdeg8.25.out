Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 8
Input depth of recursion: Use old (0) or new scaled (1) version? 
Scaled version, depth = 25
Total before scaling: neg def = 6.10577, non = 137.267, unknown = 16.6276
(sum = 160)
Total after scaling: neg def = 0.0381611, non = 0.857916, unknown = 0.103923
(sum = 1)
0.0381611 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.142084
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.857916
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.961839
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.909878
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0519613
