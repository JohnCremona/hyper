Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 8
Input depth of recursion: Use old (0) or new scaled (1) version? 
Scaled version, depth = 20
Total before scaling: neg def = 2.93505, non = 132.397, unknown = 24.6682
(sum = 160)
Total after scaling: neg def = 0.0183441, non = 0.82748, unknown = 0.154176
(sum = 1)
0.0183441 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.17252
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.82748
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.981656
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.904568
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.077088
