Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 10
Use full (0) or simplified (1) criterion? Input depth of recursion: 
After recursion in the quarter box, non = 0.390288, neg = 0.185076
0.046269 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.152428
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.847572
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.953731
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.900652
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0530795
