Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 4
Use full (0) or simplified (1) criterion? Input depth of recursion: 
After recursion in the quarter box, non = 0.402392, neg = 0.582329
0.145582 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.149402
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.850598
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.854418
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.852508
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.00190985
