Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 8
Use full (0) or simplified (1) criterion? Input depth of recursion: 
After recursion in the quarter box, non = 0.409928, neg = 0.281139
0.0702848 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.147518
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.852482
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.929715
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.891099
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0386166
