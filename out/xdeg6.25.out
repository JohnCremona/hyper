Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 6
Input depth of recursion: Use old (0) or new scaled (1) version? 
Scaled version, depth = 25
Total before scaling: neg def = 12.363, non = 139.821, unknown = 7.81592
(sum = 160)
Total after scaling: neg def = 0.077269, non = 0.873882, unknown = 0.0488495
(sum = 1)
0.077269 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.126118
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.873882
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.922731
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.898306
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0244248
