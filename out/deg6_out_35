Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 6
Use full (0) or simplified (1) criterion? Input depth of recursion: 
After recursion in the quarter box, non = 0.441439, neg = 0.421565
0.105391 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.13964
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.86036
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.894609
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.877484
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0171245
