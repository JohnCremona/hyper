Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 10
Use full (0) or simplified (1) criterion? Input depth of recursion: 
After recursion in the quarter box, non = 0.331085, neg = 0.145144
0.0362859 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.167229
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.832771
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.963714
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.898243
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0654714
