Density of non-negative definite real polynomials of degree 6
Input depth of recursion: Use old (0) or new scaled (1) version? 
Scaled version, depth = 30
Total before scaling: neg def = 14.1398, non = 141.606, unknown = 4.25423
(sum = 160)
Total after scaling: neg def = 0.0883735, non = 0.885038, unknown = 0.0265889
(sum = 1)
0.0883735 <= (neg.def.density) <= 0.114962
lower bound for non-neg def density  = 0.885038
upper bound for non-neg def density  = 0.911627
middle value for non-neg def density = 0.898332
error bound for non-neg def density  = 0.0132945
